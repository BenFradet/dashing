## Motivation

We've been wanting to measure the impact and health of the [Snowplow](https://github.com/snowplow)
open source organization for a while.

As a first step, this project incorporate the following set of dashboards:

### Hero repo stars

The evolution of the number of stars of your "hero" repository as a function of time:

### Other repos stars

The evolution of the number of stars of the top 5 repositories inside the organization (excluding
the hero repo) as a function of time:

### Open pull requests

The number of open pull requests created by people inside and outside the organization as a function
of time:
